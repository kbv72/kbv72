👧🏻Do you want to explore the potential and feasibility of data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence for your product or business? I can help you identify the problems we can solve with AI and ML. 

💁🏻I have 25+ end-to-end ML projects delivered with excellent reviews, working with global teams . I have experience of taking a project from ideation, where journey begins with evaluating data and conceptualizing the approach, to the final stage of deploying the prediction ML models .

🤝🏻	In last 4+ years, I have engineered and deployed cutting-edge tech in NLP, Computer vision and Data Science. In addition, I have solid base in data engineering and MLOps. I specialize in creating automated ML workflows with active learning i.e., continuous model life cycle monitoring and improvement in model performance metrics with new data streaming.
